Do not add any comments to any code you generate for me.
Do not create README files or any .md files in my project.
Do not start a server; I already have one running.
Only explain code when I explicitly ask for an explanation.
Do not build or run my code or lint my code unless I clearly tell you to do so.
Always use my existing config of logger to log info, warn and error.
